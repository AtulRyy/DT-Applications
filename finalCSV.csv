I’ve developed skills in Unity for game development, and I have an intermediate understanding of SQL and Python. What sets me apart is my passion for both tech and life outside of it—when I’m not coding or developing projects, I’m playing badminton, taking long drives, or enjoying music. I’m particularly excited about combining my tech skills with my creativity to build something innovative, especially in the game development space. That’s what makes me, well, me!""";"""My coding adventure started with curiosity, and it’s been an exciting journey ever since. I dove into Python and SQL, building a solid foundation in programming logic. Then, I ventured into game development with Unity, where I brought my ideas to life through 2D and 3D projects like chess models and a tic-tac-toe game, along with a small shooting game. Each project pushed me to learn more, whether it was problem-solving, coding efficiency, or creative design.

One of my big moments was participating in an AI workshop, where I got certified and realized how powerful AI can be in transforming ideas into solutions. Coding has not only taught me technical skills but also how to approach challenges with patience and creativity.

I’ve worked on simple web development projects, like creating interactive websites and small applications using React and Node.js. I have participated in Smart India Hackathon 2023 in which I worked on a green environment project to eradicate illegal garbage dumping and informing the local authorities about it, also fining the miscreants. It was an idea which got selected from the University and unfortunately did not make it through the next round. In this SIH 2024 I have lead my team through the Internal Hackathon that was conducted and got selected to the next level of screening. The idea is to create a platform to educate engineering student about concepts required to crack placements by giving them structured resources in the form of mind maps so they don't have to ponder over 100's of resources available in net. Regular tests and competitions would be conducted to improve their learning. We have 2 USP's. First being we are building an AI model to better the student learning by helping them solve tests with hints and suggestions and enforcing them to solve questions rather than giving up on it. The second one being that our platform provides these services to 4 branches of engineering that being CSE, ECE, Mech, Civil unlike other platforms which is available only for CSE. Since my specialization is in IoT I have build a prototype rover which uses motion and IR sensors to follow soldiers in combat missions. The rover would carry supplies and ammunition on it, it also uses camera to relay live video and GPS sensor to track its location. I am further improving the rover to send it to the DRDO in order to get a funding acquired.";"Yes";"https://github.com/Punvenkz10101";"https://www.linkedin.com/in/puneeth-venkat-7731b5293/";;"Yes";"I LOVED the Interface and Working of this Registration Page!!!!!
